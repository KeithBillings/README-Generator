# README-Generator

## Description

In this homework assignment I was tasked with creating a command-line application that generates a new README.md file based on user's input. 

## Guide

Upon cloning this repository, install dependencies with the command:

```sh
npm install
```

The application will be invoked with the command: 

```sh
node index.js
```

The user will be prompted for their GitHub username and other information pertaining to the project the README is for.

The README will be populated with the following:

* Project title
* Description
* Table of Contents
* Installation
* Usage
* Screenshot File Path
* Tests
* Author(s)
* License
* Questions
  * User GitHub profile picture
  * User GitHub email
* At least one badge
